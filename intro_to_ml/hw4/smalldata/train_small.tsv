0	i ve been to me julio three times it s a decent spot for appetizers and drinks but nothing to write home about the beef tacos were worse than taco bell the chicken tacos were decent and the bang bang shrimp tacos were good the prices are high considering the small portions and they give you popcorn instead of chips and salsa the first time i went they forgot my order of al pastor tacos but at least the manager comped me a margarita i m disappointed because i wanted to like this place i never thought i d say this but go to laredo s instead for tex mex if you have to stay in the fitchburg area
0	if you like your meal with a side of arrogance this is your place waited 45 minutes after our reservation time to sit down asked for a complimentary bottle of wine for our frustration and was flatly refused and there was no one else to whom to plead my case as i was speaking to the owner this was after i received an e mail from said owner the previous week saying that if i was more than 15 minutes late i would lose my 100 deposit in sum if i make them wait for 15 minutes i lose 100 if they make me wait for 45 they lose nothing well nothing except the business of all my friends and hopefully yelp readers
0	you know i have eaten at liliana s many times and they have some very good food but i don t know that i ve ever had worse service than what my family and i experience last night when we tried to enjoy a meal notice the emphasis on tried from the very beginning the service wasn t great it took a long time to even get some water much less some drinks on top of that we had to ask 4 times for a children s menu we never received it and instead got a brief listing of some of the items on the children s menu after finally getting our drinks we ordered our meals our appetizers came out relatively quickly as did the children s meal then we waited and waited then we start to notice food coming out to people who came in after us not only had we not seen our meals but we also hadn t been offered drink refills we asked our server what was going on the first excuse was i m at the whim of the executive chef oh so the executive chef is determining who gets food and not the order that people ordered interesting so we wait some more more time goes by and we ask about our food again because now we re seeing people who came in 20 30 minutes after us paying their bill and leaving this time the server has no excuse or even an estimated timeline and instead offers us some drinks i would have even accepted a lie about what happened and while i understand that people order different items and some things take longer than others none of us ordered complicated menu items and that doesn t excuse having people sit for almost two hours without having their meal served to them finally as we approached the two hour mark we all decided we had had enough and told them we wanted to pay the bill and leave the server did me the favor of drinks and meals are on them really what meals if my meals are on the house then can i please have them so we left and sorry liliana s but you lost our patronage
0	this is the worst store ever i have ever dealed with i checked with them if they deliver and they said yes their guy passed my home and said he cannot make up to the hill while he does not my home is not up on the hill just come back i called him and asked him to stop there and i will go out to meet him he agreed on the phone but when i went out he was gone i called their store and was hoping they can tell that guy to wait for me but do not carry my kids pizza and run away the store manager s attitude was horrible i will never order pizza from this store nor any people i know
1	been going to sophia s pretty regularly for 4 5 years now the atmosphere relatively european very close set if you re claustrophobic don t bother i like the family style seating most of the time and have gotten to know some of the regulars over time which makes it quite fun you feel much more like you re participating in the restaurant rather than simply spending money there the local home style feel of the place is one of the main reasons i keep coming back if you re in a hurry or have a large group i would strongly recommend going elsewhere i usually don t walk in there with a group larger than four also try going at off peak times for breakfast and you won t have to wait before 8 30 9 00 or after 11 30 12 00 is usually a good bet i ve seen so many negative reviews about the lines and waiting and not enough space to those people i challenge you to find any half way decent breakfast place within 5 miles of the square area that doesn t have a huge crowd between 9 00 and 12 00 on a saturday or sunday morning the food it s good fresh local food all at a pretty decent price it s very solid but nothing i would rant about go to any of the more commercial type breakfast places in the downtown area and you ll expect to pay a few dollars more for the same quality food there s pretty high variance in quality of the food that comes out of the kitchen compared to other places the coffee is above average about what you d expect from a reputable breakfast place they have fresh squeezed juices that are somewhat pricey but delicious pastry the pastry is what sets them apart from other places they really have some of the best pastry in madison the apricot roll is my favorite
0	tried this place last summer in an attempt to end a bout of chipotle going yeah i drank the chipotle koolaid for a bit i m better now thanks anyway i read all the great reviews of poblano and went for some takeout read that the owner came from tex tubbs which we love and hoped for great food in a more authentic mex style what we got was little tacos made of dried out tortillas filled with dry and chewy fillings i was the only one in there the dining room was totally empty yes right at dinner time and it still took them something like 20 minutes to put my order together the whole time i felt like i was interrupting them by ordering one of my real pet peeves about any business we had as i recall the el pastor the chorizo the asada and a veggie taco all the meats were rubbery and dry and the tortillas tasted a week old stale and lifeless good thing i asked for hot sauce before i left i ended up using all of it just to moisten the damned things i highly doubt i will ever go back i gave two stars because the onions and cilantro were good
1	when i see a sub 4 star overall rating on yelp i have certain expectations and i ll often actually avoid the place but a friend of mine wanted to check umami out so i checked my assumptions and i loved it we went during restaurant week so it was packed at we ate at the bar the buzz in the place was great and you could tell it was a place where people were having a great time brandon and i ignored the restaurant week menu simply because it would have been way too much food and we shared an order of the buns the dumplings and we split a bowl of ramen the pork belly buns were delicious the pork was soft and flavorful and the hoisin sauce was the perfect pair the dumplings were less remarkable simply because they bore a strong resemblance to asian kitchen take out but i love asian kitchen take out so i thought they were good the tonkotsu ramen was delicious this was the part i was most nervous about because people seemed to have the most negative opinions about that but it was great the broth was flavorful the noodles were nice and thin the egg was absolutely delicious even the pork which was my least favorite part was nice and salty and added a lot of flavor on a tip from another yelper we decided to split a bowl it s 1 50 extra and they give you separate bowls extra meat and an extra egg great deal and the perfect amount of food
1	great for brunch standard breakfast fare but done really well i ve been here a ton of times and try to get something new each time some of my favorites vera cruz chicken avocado omelette it s in the smarter choices section but it is super flavorful and comes with lots of avocado parisian benedict denver omelette biscuit eggs gravy seasonal favorite banana bread french toast this is to die for my favorite waiter is nico but generally the staff is friendly the place can be very busy if you go between 10 11am on saturday and sunday but i ve never had a wait longer than 20 mins parking can be a little tricky there is plenty of it but the spa and gym next door have reserved parking so you may have to find a space in the parking structure in the back i know it s a chain but one of my favorite breakfast places in madison
0	if i could give 0 stars i would i got food poisoning from this establishment i feel bad because i can tell the woman who owns the place is a kind lady but due to my food poisoning issue i think she really needs to rethink what they are doing in the kitchen i ordered the soup the chicken rafissa sp and my hubby ordered the chicken bastilla the soup tasted as if it was minestrone with a few added spices not luxury and it was lukewarm the chicken rafissa seemed like it tasted ok it was heavy looking not much color in the dish just a brown sloppy appearance but the crisped up puff pastry was what i was looking for unfortunately the pastry was overly drenched in oil too greasy for my liking the flavors were ok but it was too heavy overall my experience with moroccan food previously was not so drab but i did eat a majority of it as it wasn t that bad the chicken was ok but it seemed lukewarm as well i can guarantee that this was not made fresh but simply reheated and put in a tagine for decoration they forgot my saffron rice and when the waitress finally came back and asked how things were she finally gave me some very little actually my hubby liked his chicken bastilla i had a bite and didn t much care for the flavor combination im not a fan of sweetness from cinnamon and savory egg at the same time the bill came back with soup being charged extra on the topic of prices this food is way overpriced it should have been 7 bucks for my meal if this restaurant is going to survive which i m not sure they need to be willing to rethink how they do things in the back of the kitchen whatever they did gave me food poisoning they need to cook things fresh have better attention todetails and also have lesser prices
1	i ve been back to old chicago and i think they deserve an upgrade the service is steadily good there s always new beer to try and the prices are reasonable i had a pizza there with a friend and we were both pleasantly surprised at how good it was it was a chicago style which by the way is emphatically not a chicago style pizza with pepperoni and green peppers the crust was buttery and bready like a good pan pizza should be with great cheese and the just right amount of pepperoni i thought they could have gone heavier on the green pepper but i m just nitpicking service was attentive friendly prompt and timely i m starting to hang out there a bit with friends as it beats quite a few other neighborhood places out in price and quality while also having more pleasant surroundings and room to move without tripping on your neighbor as at some other area watering holes
0	i have to say i don t get the hype about this place after many good reviews by local press i gave this place a try in a party of three two complete failures on our food first one burger was over cooked to the point of being completely dry and un edible second when you can order a burger with a portobello mushroom traded for beef it s supposed to be a whole mushroom cap so you can eat it like a burger when the mushroom is cut into many thin slices it s impossible to eat as a sandwich cheese forgotten salad dressing forgotten service poor and slow it seemed like the nice people working there were trained as bartenders not waitstaff one star for the cheese curds they were good but i m never going back there are too many places near there that have their act together and serve good food that i can give my business to
1	this is my second visit here my first time was when it first opened and there was not a whole lot to write home about tonight it was fantastic to begin with service was a little slow it took about 5 min for our server to come and another 10 to get our cocktails but she was super nice and apologetic and the tasty drinks made up for it my man and i both got the special drink a ginger snap which contained yahara bay vodka ginger liquer lemon and lemon lime soda to start with i got the black bean chili topped with cheddar and sour cream although vegan versions of both are available it was really really good for the main event i got the faux fish fry which i have been dying to try i was definately not disappointed it was excellent it came with 2 fish patties rosemary red skinned potatoes and coleslaw plus my chili for 12 i will definately come back for it again and again my man got the bowl of chili which he loved a side of potatoes really good and a side of hummus which was not very good it didn t seem to have any garlic in it at all and just tasted dirty but everything else was awesome our food was soooooo good that we had to try dessert he got a smore dessert which was a dense chocolate cake topped with a flambeed marshmallow fluff i haven t been able to have marshmallow in years so that was a real treat i got raspberry cheesecake which did not disappoint i am really happy with almost everything about this trip and will definately be back for the fish again
1	my husband and i enjoyed our recent dinner it s an adult burger joint with a bar and cool décor the staff was very friendly and accommodating our bartender did a great job meeting my request to make my drink the sugar mama even sweeter my husband tried one of their housemade sodas and it was very good would get both beverages again we loved the french onion dip crispy housemade chips with housemade french onion dip lots of onions but oh so delish my husband tried the backyard bbq burger and i had the farmhouse both were very good but the burger patties themselves lacked full flavor think the graze burger for those of you who ve had the pleasure and joy the highlight were the shakes omg i have no words simply scrumptious and nothing matches them we tried the vanilla coconut and toasted marshmallow we both agreed the burgers alone would not bring us back too many wonderful burgers elsewhere but the beverages and french onion dip were definitely a draw
0	maybe because it s organic bland though the atmosphere is calming and inviting for a leisurely dinner the food missed it s mark that s why i gave it 2 stars i had the diced fresh beets i can t even remember what was in it forgettable i guess i had to ask for salt to bring out the flavor they don t like to use salt in their cooking and we had to ask for it since it was not on the table i do not use a lot of salt but the appetizer and our entree needed it i order the bass which was ok but i thought maybe slightly undercooked it came with fingerling potatoes and some spinach that was bland my friend had fresh pasta cavatelle in a light pesto sauce the pasta was too chewy and it had a texture more like eating squid though pesto is basil based it was too strong maybe a bit more roasted ground pine nuts would help offset the strong basil flavor she did have a side of mushrooms which was very good the service was good to but maybe a bit too conscientious better that then none at all
1	anna s pizza is to die for anna s sauce is amazing and no she will not share the receipt i ve asked many times this is a small mom pop and anna s family is fully involved her husband jeff makes the pizza lonnie does the deliveries and anna is the waitress if you are looking for a fast meal this is not the place but if you want the best pizza ever then it is worth the wait hint if you are going to dine in call and order your pizza ahead of time anna will set up a table and everything waiting when you arrive quaint atmosphere with wonderful staff that just wants your experience to be the best possible
1	went there tonight for dinner we were seated right away in a comfortable booth i had the 6 oz sirloin 11 99 that came with a salad and a loaded baked potatoe the steak was done perfectly and unbelievably tender and bursting with flavor the potatoe was super good too fresh not dried out or over baked when they say loaded they mean loaded butter sour cream cheese and bacon the salad was fresh and delish with plenty of cucumber tomatoes and croutons all you can eat fresh baked bread my friend had the shaved prime rib sandwich that i tried it was also very good service was great no complaints we will be back
1	eldorado has the best margaritas i ve had in madison tex tubb s is a close second but eldorado is the best check out their happy hour the drinks are cheaper you can even get discounts on neat pours of their amazing tequila selection i ve been here quite a few times and never been disappointed the drinks are great the staff is wonderful and the food is fantastic the brunch deserves its own paragraph it s my favorite brunch in town good drinks and wonderful tex mex food i m reading a 3 star review on the sidebar as i write this and i can t believe it someone complaining about no free chips and salsa they re really cheap the queso which we ve ordered twice and the waitstaff always explained was not normal queso and the lack of frozen margaritas seriously if you want cheap by the numbers big box type mexican go to pedro s this restaurant is for people that enjoy good food and drinks sorry back to the brunch i ve had half a dozen items off the brunch menu and loved every one if you come here on sunday morning you might want to make a reservation because everyone knows what a great brunch they have and they all come on sunday it s a bit more expensive than your average mexican or tex mex place but the quality of the food drinks and service is well worth it
0	i used to be a huge fan of this place and was excited to bring my visiting family there because of their gluten free options when we walked in there were only 4 tables being occupied i had my 9 month old daughter with so we needed to find a table large enough for the 6 of us and a high chair our only option were two tables in the back that we had to push together i had no problem doing so but my issue with both tables was how dirty they were and clearly had not been wiped when i went and found the high chair shocker again disgusting now it came to order my father n i made our way to the counter where a friendly young woman took our order we ordered two greek wraps awesome and a california turkey wrap again awesome i still never understand why your drinks are in a cooler hidden around the corner which to this day no one ever tells you about after waiting 30 minutes one of the greek wraps made it to the table which was dropped by a very awkward young man who was aimlessly walking around with different orders before ours and didn t have the chicken that was requested 15 minutes later the 2nd greek wrap has arrived no chicken then after 10 minutes both wraps come back made with chicken then another 15 minutes later my california wrap arrives all with fruit cups now in the menu they specify you get tortilla chips and homemade salsa and if you would like fruit it s a 1 upcharge again no biggie we like our fruit but you didn t even mention the fact hey sorry folks we seem to have ran out of chips is fruit ok lastly i really feel you should have someone checking the appearance of your restrooms both were in poor form and needed some attention this was not how i felt when you first arrived on commerce drive it was actually a go to spot that i often bragged about to fellow friends and family however after today s experience especially now that i have a young child i do not have the patience for yolas cafe maybe if i find myself bored with a lot of time on my hands i will stop by to wait for a 20 minute latte
0	i went to francesca s for the first time with great anticipation after hearing about their good italian food at reasonable prices for many years boy was i disappointed we ate at the bar and the first strike was the bartender s answer to my question of what was their house red wine which was i don t even know what that means because they offer 7 or 8 wines by the glass that was out first feel bad of the evening additionally their wine glasses are very small yet the prices don t reflect it as for the food the caesar salad had clearly been sitting in the cooler for many hours and the dressing was tasteless any self respecting italian restaurant should have a decent caesar salad on a similar note the minnestrone was incredibly salty our entrees pasta and fish were decent but we already had been let down by the attitude the wine price small glass ratio and disappointing soup salad by that point we were glad we had tried it but will not return
1	i live close to here so you d think that we go to g b a lot but we actually don t it s not bad food not by a long shot but we just don t go here that often i will state a bad point from my point of view the menu is limited on one side it s sandwiches and burgers and the other side is just pizza so when i went here for the first couple times there was no food on the menu that appealed to me so i ended up sharing with my family and having fries and sipping pepsi but then i went with my dad one time and i just said you know what i m just gonna go for it i ordered a g b burger which is this monstrous burger with two patties and the works tomato onion bacon two kinds of sauce lettuce and two slices of american swiss or cheddar cheese your choice i am not exaggerating when i say it was by far the best thing that involved grilled beef slapped between bread aka a hamburger that i have ever tasted in my life it was heavenly i ended up barely finishing it because it was just that big the pizza is amazing for a place that doesn t specialize in pizza they have classics and then they plop on sausage and other goodies to get you on your knees begging the fries are in my opinion the best in madison and the surrounding area and the cheese curds are way up on the list too the chicken tenders as an appetizer are delicious as well the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because of the small menu and i m also not a huge fan of the ambiance
